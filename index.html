				The REAL reason for taking CMSC (or whatever your course is):
				<p class="smalltext">First, I actually had no idea what course have I entered myself into. Second, I took CMSC since I know that it involves computers, which actually brings me to my choices back in High School(Computer Science, Electronics and Communications Engineering, and Computer Engineering). Lastly, the real reason right now that I am taking CMSC is to be prepared for the further advancement that technology is about to bring us.</p><hr width="1000px" color="#000000" />
				Favorite CMSC subject so far and WHY: <strong>CMSC 131</strong>
				<p class="smalltext">Why: It was due to the fact that I enjoyed coding and exploring a lot in Assembly, even though I know that it will be rarely used with regards to the working world.</p><hr width="1000px" color="#000000" />
				Favorite PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE and WHY (If someone puts HTML/CSS here kick them out): <strong>Java</strong>
				<p class="smalltext">Why: I think it is Java since I thought that a lot of previous concepts left hanging from Python and C, together with their differences as sequential and object-oriented being cleared up.</p><hr width="1000px" color="#000000" />
				Favorite food: <strong>Sinigang</strong> | Favorite Color: <strong><span id="highlight">Blue</span></strong>
